# Decentralized File Storage System using Blockchain and IPFS

## Project Description

The **Decentralized File Storage System** leverages Blockchain technology and the **InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)** to provide a secure, decentralized way of storing and sharing files. This system ensures that files are stored across multiple nodes in a distributed network, increasing reliability, security, and censorship resistance.

Traditional cloud storage solutions rely on centralized servers, which can be vulnerable to attacks, data breaches, or loss of data due to server failures. This decentralized approach eliminates these issues by using IPFS to store files in a peer-to-peer network and Blockchain to verify ownership and maintain a transparent, tamper-proof ledger of file transactions.

## Features

- **Decentralized File Storage**: Upload, store, and retrieve files on a peer-to-peer IPFS network.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Securely track file ownership, uploads, and transactions on the blockchain.
- **Data Integrity**: Hashing mechanisms ensure that files remain unchanged and tamper-resistant.
- **Censorship Resistance**: Files stored on IPFS are distributed across multiple nodes, making the system resistant to censorship and single points of failure.
- **Access Control**: The system uses cryptographic mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access specific files.

## Tech Stack

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum / Hyperledger
- **Storage**: IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (for Ethereum)
- **Frontend**: React.js / Vue.js
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (for storing metadata)
